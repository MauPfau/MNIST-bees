# MNIST_bees
Basic image recognition with MNIST dataset, and recognition of Bees


## _Description_
We build 3 neural networks, each designed for different purposes, all for image classification.
1. **Handwriting recognition** : on MNIST dataset, we add other randomly created images, and train the model to recognize the hand written ones
2. **Number recognition** : on MNIST, we train the model to recognize the written number
3. **Bee recognition** : on a Kaggle dataset, we have labbeled images of Bees, Wasps, and Others, we train the model to recognize which is which
